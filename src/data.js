  intro: "Let's be real: trying to summarize a human being in a digital bento box is a bit of a paradox. You're looking for a signal in the noise, and I'm looking to show you I'm the person who builds the antenna.",
  context: "By title, I'm a CS Leader and Revenue Architect. In practice, I'm a Builder-Operator who operates at the intersection of high-level strategy and technical execution. Whether I'm standing shoulder to shoulder with the frontline or sitting in the boardroom, my approach remains the same: begin with the end in mind.",

      title: "AI-Driven, Human-Centric",
      description: "I'm a practitioner of vibe-coding (or \"agentic engineering\" if you're feeling formal). I use AI as a force multiplier to bridge the gap between retention strategy and technical execution. I build the tools my teams actually need, rather than waiting for them to appear on a roadmap.",

      title: "Radical Candor and Open Ears",
      description: "I'm a student first and a teacher second. I value the space for people to be their authentic selves, but I won't shy away from the tough conversations that help us all push past our current limits.",
    },
  ],
  beyond: "When I'm not optimizing retention or building SaaS tools, I'm likely focused on my own \"recomposition.\" Whether that's in the gym or maintaining a health-conscious lifestyle, I believe in pushing to new limits. I am compassionate about all living things and keep well-being top of mind, but I believe in purposeful momentum over \"hustle culture\" -- driving energy toward the things that truly matter without redlining for the sake of it.",
  closing: "I'm here to solve problems before they become fires. If you're looking for someone who translates complexity into simplicity and actually enjoys the build, let's talk.",
